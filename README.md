# ant-hetero-threshold

This is the set of C++ codes accompaying the following paper, which I ask you to cite if you use the codes:

[Naoki Masuda, Thomas A. O'Shea-Wheller, Carolina Doran, Nigel R. Franks.
Computational model of collective nest selection by ants with heterogeneous acceptance thresholds.
Royal Society Open Science, 2, 140533 (2015).](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.140533)

The code does not use a full potential of C++ and in most part written in C.

The header of each .cc file explains the usage and which figures in the paper the code produces.
